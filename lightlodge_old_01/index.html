          <p>The benefits of group therapy:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Support: Group therapy provides a supportive environment where individuals can share their experiences and feelings with others who are going through similar challenges. This can help individuals feel less alone and more understood.</li>
            <li>Perspective: Participating in group therapy allows individuals to gain new perspectives and insights from others' experiences and perspectives. This can help individuals feel less isolated and more connected to others.</li>
            <li>Empathy: Group therapy can foster empathy and understanding among group members as they share and discuss their experiences. This can help individuals feel more connected and less isolated.</li>
            <li>Personal growth: Group therapy can facilitate personal growth and self-awareness as individuals reflect on their own experiences and behaviors in the context of the group.</li>
