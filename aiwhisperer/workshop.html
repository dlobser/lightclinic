    <h2>EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://stable-diffusion-art.com/">Stable Diffusion Art homepage</a></li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>STABLE DIFFUSION INTERFACES</h2>
    <p>
        In order to use Stable Diffusion, you&rsquo;ll need to be able to interface with it! While many people choose to
        install it locally on their computer, we are recommending that all students begin their journey by using Stable
        Diffusion hosted on the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cloud hosting provides professional-grade computational resources that are not available to most consumers, as
        well as extra features and extensions that would generally require time and labor to install and configure. This
        means faster image generation, less waiting, less troubleshooting, and more learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anything you learn by using cloud-hosted interfaces can be migrated to a local install if and when you decide to do
        your work offline.

    </ul>

    <h3>CLOUD BASED</h3>
    <p>
        In this section, we will get you started with using a remote computer to interface with Stable Diffusion via
        Automatic1111. While there are several interfaces available, we believe that Automatic1111 is the best one to
        start with in order to get your bearings before moving on to other applications like ComfyUI and AiNodes. As we
        are working on the cloud, these interfaces can be used from any computer, regardless of hardware, and only
        require a good internet connection.
    </p>
    <p><strong>PREFERRED CHOICE</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.thinkdiffusion.com/">Think Diffusion AI </a> - SD 1.5, XL, ControlNet, Decorum, etc.
            A1111 or ComfyUI ~ $.50 - $2.00 / hr, Google Account Integration
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Alternative Cloud-based options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://stablediffusion.fr/webui">Stable Diffusion WebUI</a> (basic text to image only - no
            extensions, no login required). Good to play with before getting your feet wet. Minimal UI with minimal
            functions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://rundiffusion.com/pricing">Run DIffusion AI </a> - Free and paid options, includes
            Automatic1111 as well as extra interfaces and 24/7 customer support.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>LOCAL INSTALL</h3>
    <p>
        If you are ready to install on your local machine (Linux or Mac only), try the instructions found here:
        <a href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC111</a>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC111">Automatic1111</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
    <h4>COST</h4>
    <p>
        Cloud-based interfaces like Think Diffusion AI can cost anywhere from $.50 to $2.00 per hour of active usage.
        While this can add up, it is an investment in learning. Consider how much time you will be actively working
        before making a decision. You can monitor your usage within the interface to keep track of costs in real-time.
    </p>
    <h4>COMPUTER SPECIFICATIONS</h4>
    <p>
        For local installations, you'll need a computer with a modern NVIDIA GPU. Stable Diffusion and interfaces like
        Automatic1111 are computationally intensive and may not run well (or at all) on integrated graphics or older
        GPUs. If you're unsure about your computer's compatibility, feel free to reach out for assistance.
    </p>
    <h4>INTERNET CONNECTION</h4>
    <p>
        Using cloud-based interfaces requires a stable and relatively fast internet connection. If you're experiencing
        lag or disconnections, check your internet speed and consider using a wired connection for a more reliable
        experience.
